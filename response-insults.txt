Bro, you really just sold me a bag of oregano Fuck off
This answer is stepped on Heavily
You promised me gas and gave me absolute trash
The weight on this answer is way off, fix your scale
Bro is moving like a fed with that response
You shorted me on the logic, fam
Who is your supplier for these bad takes
This is a total finesse, I want my money back
That answer is mostly stems and seeds, bro
You’re acting like the plug who says "5 minutes" and shows up next week
Don't come around here with that weak product
Pure baking soda Zero substance
Bro ghosted on the actual facts
Did you cut this answer with flour? It’s weak
Scam. Literal scam
Brooooo, that’s not it
-1000 aura for that one
Such an NPC
You’re cooked
Zero rizz in that logic
Cap
Blud really thought he did something
L take
Who let bro cook
Brainrot levels are critical right now
Actual bot behavior
Bro is yapping at this point
What in the Skibidi toilet was that
You fell off
Major side eye
Bro woke up and chose to be wrong
That’s crazy
Imagine thinking that was the answer
Go back to the lobby
Skill issue
Bro is lagging IRL
I’m cringe-maxxing just watching you
Stop glazing yourself, you're wrong
Pressed for what? That was incorrect
Maidenless behavior
This guy gets no bitches
Big yikes
It’s giving confused
You are the weakest link, bro
Jose says you're stupid Really fucking stupid, bro
Who raised Cuz
Who birthed blood
Yo mama so fat, she squashed your IQ at birth
Truck. Pure truck
Bro really tried to sell me drywall and call it gas
That logic is so stepped on it’s basically dirt
I paid premium prices for this mid answer
You promised me the loud, but you brought me silence
Stop trying to finesse me with that crushed-up aspirin logic
Your source is selling you absolute bricks, my guy
The scale don't lie, bro, and you are short
Bro said "pull up" and then didn't even have the product
This feels like a setup. Are you wearing a wire with that answer?
Nice packaging, but the bag is empty
You just got taxed for zero knowledge
That’s straight reggie. I’m not smoking that
You sold me a dream and delivered a nightmare
I tested the purity of that answer and it came back 100% bogus
Don't call my phone with that weak product ever again
Betchu Fernando would've got it right
